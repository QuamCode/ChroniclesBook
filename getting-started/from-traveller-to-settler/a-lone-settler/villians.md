# Villians

### Current Abilities

**Survivor of the Prison Dimension -** As survivors of Dormis, Villains bodies are naturally stronger than most will ever dream to achieve. They naturally have resistance and strength.

**Controversial Figure -** Villains very presence stirs controversy wherever they go. They not only have the bad omen effect, but also cannot get hero of the village, and are immediately targeted by Iron Golems.

**Unlucky Life -** Life as a Villain is always riddled with tough challenges. As such Villains permanently get the unluck effect.

### Lore

Villains are a hardy and resourceful people that are accustomed to surviving in harsh environments. A species descending from the diverse occupants of the prison dimension, Villains are commonly treated with contempt by other species. Across the other dimensions, they have earned the reputation of being troublemakers and criminals having resulted in the origin of their unfortunate name.

#### Appearance

Being the amalgamated descendants of many species, Villains posses similar features to other peoples, albeit typically less pronounced in appearance. They have crown and jaw horns like the Frostkin, dark under-eye markings like the Netherkin, pointed ears like the Faefolk, and thick eyebrows like the Dwellers. They also have larger canines but not to the extent that they would protrude outside of their mouth as is the case with Nereids. In many cases in which a Villain is trying to evade detection, it is not unusual for an individual to file down their horns and canines in the attempt of passing as a human. This disguise might prove ineffective in a side-by-side comparison though, as Villains are significantly taller on average and have grey-ish skin color tones.

#### Culture/Society

Villain culture in Dormis is vastly different from that outside of the prison dimension. Compared to other Mods, the Judge enacts a heavier hand than most, creating a strict set of rules that govern every aspect of conduct and daily life with zero tolerance for error. People within Dormis operate according to the rank allotted to them by the Judge and enjoy certain freedoms depending on that rank. Overall, the attitudes expressed by Dormis society is one of mostly quiet passivity and introversion.

Outside of Dormis, Villains typically live a life on the run, constantly trying to avoid detection, capture, and a return visit to their home dimension. As such, they might live secretive, nomadic lives in which they must be on constant alert to any who might cause them harm. Villains are infamous for a predisposition to black-market or mob-related business practices, given that a criminal underworld may actually end up being one of the safest ways for Villains to obtain necessary goods and services. If asked, most Villains will tell you that, despite the difficulties, this life of an outcast is still far better than life in Dormis.

#### Villain Architecture and Cuisine

Minimalism is the most common theme among Villain architects. Simple houses, even ones constructed out of dirt and leaves, reflect the needs of the builder. In Dormis, one's survival depends greatly on flying under the radar and not being noticed by the Judge and those that represent her will. In turn, life outside of Dormis also depends on not drawing attention to oneself.

Villain cooking unfortunately also bears a bleak form of minimalism. Although criticized for being bland in nature, the author can anecdotally attest to the talent of a Villain meal-maker in their use of soup as a medium for sustaining many mouths with limited sustenance available. Just be sure to save all leftovers, add water, and repeat.

#### Realmkeeper Animosity

Realmkeepers and Villains have an extraordinary kind of conflict existing between them. Primarily, is is the Realmkeepers who zealously head the campaign to return every escaped Villain back into the hands of the Judge. In turn, although most Realmkeepers have long since forgotten about their original home in Dormis and their former occupation as a prison authority, the Villains remember it well, and bear this secret hatred against them.
