# The End

A disgusting lump of dimensional fabrics deep below the hollow void. Not much is known of this peculiar realm. But it is certainly a place that not many dare travel. Those who do end up in this place of nothing, often by accident, will always meet horrifying demise at the hands of the creatures of the End. Eternally tormented and tortured by the horrid and sickening energies and maws of the repulsive creatures. None hath made it out of The End alive bar the Enderlings who dare not speak of home.

Prophets and mystics vision of endless suffering at the hands of the puppetmaster of the deep.
