# Pax

Pax is a realm of peace and tranquility, and the highest current stacked dimension within Chronicles.

It contains huge mountains of dirt and nether quartz, with flowers on the tops of each peak. The dimension itself has no hostile mobs in it, you cannot starve, and you will have twice the number of hearts within the dimension. You will also get jump boost x3, and weakness x100, making this an anti-PVP dimension.

To get to it, you must fly up or build up to the block limit in Faewilds.

Pax is the origin of The Arc Gateway System that spans the cornucopia - that allows you to enter any dimension via dial up sequences. It is the only way to enter Dormis.

### Lore

Pax is a realm constructed to facilitate peace and tranquility. By nature it remains untouchable by the machinations of The Tyrant and his followers.

Currently, Pax is the home of the Realmkeepers, an expansionistic race that strives to improve the living conditions of other societies by eradicating disease and striving to maintain order and peace between the dimensions.
