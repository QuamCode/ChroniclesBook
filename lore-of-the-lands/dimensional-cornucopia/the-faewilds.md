# The Faewilds

The Faewilds is a series of ever-changing floating islands and forests. Almost entirely kept at night, it is a hostile, but rewarding dimension. Players who stay here have one less heart than usual, but gain a small amount of XP every few seconds. There also is a high increase in monster spawn rates, with phantoms being a natural part of the enemy spawns. It also has large sources of lapis ore in the stone.

To enter Faewilds you must build or fly all the way up to the block limit in the Overworld. To leave, drop down to the very bottom to return to the overworld. If shift is held in the Faewilds, the player receives slow-falling.

The Faewilds are home to the Faefolk, a magical, athletic, elvish race with an affinity for enchantment.

### Lore

The Faewild is an ever-changing landscape of floating islands and forests. Time and space behave inconsistently here, and the Faefolk that dwell within tend to lack realization of permanence, oftentimes being non-materialistic and spontaneously chaotic, having little recollection of past events or anticipation toward the future.
