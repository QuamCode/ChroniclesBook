* Autominigate-156 - Automech, Age 377: Antimatter Stabilizer Quarter 064 (Still being questioned, donâ€™t keep your eye off the thing. Most of the time the Council blows up their circuits before we can get any info out of them. This is a golden opportunity.)

* Wystan Brewstere - Human, Age 22: Cell 160

Do not worry about the escaped criminals. Tracking spells were implanted in the prisoners before detainment, so we will find each one shortly. There are many threats that continue to oppose Sector 12, but they will be swiftly dealt with.

May the Fractal Codes guide our judgment and wrath,

Realmkeeper Warden Elleen
