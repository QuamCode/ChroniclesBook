# Old Durum Good Listings

* \- Glitchtech boots from our Automech merchant, Failsafe Ninety-Nine.
* \- Magipholics stolen from an Outlander scouting camp. Nice tip from Buurco. Hunters know how to find things fast as always.
* \- Kindling Crystals from the forbidden mines. (These are not easy to come by, mind you.)
* \- More Outlander tech. Seems our Outlander tradesmen are increasing by the day. Nice.
* \- Dormis warden tools
* \- Panacea carnivorous plants. Terrifying.
* \- Ancient Frostkin relics
* \- Some unidentified Sanctum scraps. Team is still trying to figure out what these are meant for, but they seem important.
* \- Omnitech suit, size X9230 model 3919. Whatever that means.
* \- Some royal gemstones from the upper trading center mansions. They are gonna be so mad! I love it.
* \- Anarchy tomes from The Nether
* \- Someone managed to get their hands on some Enderian tech. No idea how, but it may be one of our rarest finds ever.
* \- Pocket house illegally conjured in The Faewilds
* \- Creepy spider egg cluster. The Hunters that brought them in called them “mother eggs” and told us they were extremely valuable. Saw them wriggle in the corner of one of the shops once, so they kinda freak me out. Might be profitable though.

_"Another great haul gentlemen! Durum is growing by the day, and I never thought we’d see such a wide variety of new goods every week. We are about to take over the economy right under those Gold Dwellers' noses haha!_

_Security has been a little too relaxed, but I’m sure ABSOLUTELY NOTHING will go wrong! Our merchants are some of the bests around you know. Will fill in what comes next week, hoping for some royal nether candies from our Nether tradesmen."_
