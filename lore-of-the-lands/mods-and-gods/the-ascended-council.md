# The Ascended Council

Formerly members of the most influential aristocracy within the [Sanctum](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Sanctum), the Ascended Counsel executes supreme authority over the [Omnidrome](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Omnidrome) dimension. The Counsel wields a cosmic power on par with a Mod or Modess, albeit distributed unequally among its members. As a consequence of the shared power, the Counsel's members exist in a state of entanglement, operating with something between independent personalities and a collective mind. Thoughts and sensations are shared instantaneously between members, and although some have been observed collecting together, the necessity as to why is still unknown. Some members of the Council are understandable and can be reasoned with, others simply satisfy tasks and functions without any semblance of consciousness.

Although once mortals, the Ascended Council horrifies even the Mods themselves, dynamically writing and editing the very laws of physics within the Omnidrome, which without their active presence, would rapidly collapse back into the dark singularity it once had been. The primary directive of the Ascended Counsel appears to hinge on the acquisition of knowledge and their pursuit of perfection.

### Origin

Before their ascension, The Council were high leaders and intelligent supervisors of Sanctums largest cities. Their intellect brought great prosperity within Sanctum, but it also brought with them pride. They believed they were intelligent enough to become Mods themselves, and Mods they did become. Over time, through the inspiration and knowledge shared by [The Builder](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Builder\_\(deceased\)), they were able to build a [device](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Project\_Ruination) that would seep power from the Sanctum itself, and into their minds. The only obstacle in their path was [The Builder](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Builder\_\(deceased\)) himself. So, they began to retool their mechanical counterparts for Mod takedown, the first documented [Automechs](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Automechs). Their intelligence was so influential, they were able to pull it off. The Automechs swarmed The Builder, seeping his energy, [killing the Mod of Sanctum](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Death\_of\_The\_Builder), and giving the Council ample time to suck the rest of Sanctum's energy into this device.

Soon, they would use this device, turning their flesh into machine, and their minds into one collective conscience. They left Sanctum, and created the Omnidrome, a perfect dimension to freely bend the rules to their will, and with them they took, and perfected their Automech creations. The rest of the [Outlanders](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Outlanders) were then cursed to forever roam other dimensions, leaving behind what is now a desolate wasteland of ruin that is modern Sanctum.
