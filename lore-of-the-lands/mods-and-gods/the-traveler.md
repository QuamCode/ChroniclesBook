# The Traveler

> "_There is no specific 'place' I wish to go._"\
> "_Then what is the purpose of your journey?_"\
> "_Curiosity._"

The Traveler is the Mod of [Varskspace](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Varskspace), and is the reason many adventures and explorers have the drive to seek out new lands, explore the great depths of caves, or vast ruins of cities long past; a Mod of exploration and travel. He is an elusive Mod, often times isolating himself from others or other Mods. Even the Mods themselves sometimes have no idea where he is, in ways he is a nomad Mod, but for him, his work is never done, even when travelling far from others.

Some say the spires inside the dimension are important locations marked by The Traveler by his famous javelin, as they bear resemblance to the tip of the weapon itself, hence the name Locator Spires. However, explorations of these locations show no abnormal or strange signs for regular beings, and the mystery of these structures still remain to this day.

#### The Creator of Varskspace

The Traveler is the creator of Varskspace, as it's the youngest dimension conceived so far. Eons of work was put into this dimension by him, as he learned how to put the doors to Varskspace within the super-heated particles of a lightning bolt. The perfect dimension for travel. He made it not just for himself, but he also pities nomads and travelers who are down on their luck, especially [Outlanders](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Outlanders). He had always believed there needs to be a second chance for escape, and for the Outlanders who use it often, it is a life-saver for their constant travels. The Varskspace has been abused too, sadly, being one of the only methods Villain's have used to escape the fiery clutches of [Dormis](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Dormis). This has caused some disagreements between the Mod of Dormis ([The Judge](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Judge)) and the Traveler, but both realize there can't be much done about it for the time being.

#### Innominatam, The Cosmic Tunneller

Innominatam was the companion, and "pet" of The Traveler before he perfected the Varskspace. Before that, The Traveler was often found roaming the empty halls of [The Void](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Void), looking for meaning in the darkness. But even the void isn't completely empty, housing huge celestial beasts that traverse through it like an ocean. After eons of searching, The Traveler came face to face with Innominatam as it was speeding through the emptiness. With The Traveler's mind made up, he lassoed Innominatam, and began the dance of the void worm that would soon end in him "taiming" the beast. Later, they became the best of companions, and Innominatam offered ways of entering and exiting the Void by new means. Through the information he gained in the void, along with eons of tinkering and testing, he was eventually able to perfect the Varskspace, and opened the dimension to any race that wished to find a way out through the use of a lightning bolt.

The true name of Innominatam is unknown, as he was given that name by the Traveler himself. There are rumors that "Varsk" is just the beginning of Innominatam's very long real name, but as of now, its correct name is completely undetermined. Innominatam was also a whopping 90,000 miles long. So big, in fact, that the worm had to create multiple interdimensional portals to travel through some of the dimensions simultaneously. Those that saw the body of the creature travelling through multiple dimensions said it was like an experience and feeling unlike any other.

Despite their companionship which seemed to last eternally, Innominatam would soon be doomed to fall at the hands of The Tyrant, the mod of war in The Nether. The Tyrant was angry at The Traveler for some unknown reason, most likely due to the construction of Varskspace, and attacked him and Innominatam. Through knowledge gained by The Judge, The Tyrant was able to overpower The Traveler in a century long battle, and kill Innominatam permanently. The repercussions of these actions were severe, as the worms body began to decay rapidly, a toxin was left in the air of multiple dimensions from the corpse of the worm. Soon, the zombie virus would spread quickly throughout multiple dimensions, and the bones of Innominatam began to interdimentionally sediment as bedrock at the bottoms or tops of some dimensions.
