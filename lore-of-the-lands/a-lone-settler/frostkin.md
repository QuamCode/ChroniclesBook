# Frostkin

### Current Abilities

**Icy Flesh -** The durable icy skin of Frostkin's allow them to take a punch, and slows have zero effect on their skeletal structure, made of permafrost. This translates to permanent resistance x1, and immunity to slows. (They are also immune to the anti-jump mechanic portion of the [Frostlock magic book](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Magic\_Books).)

**Lower Melting Point -** Despite the durability of Frostkin, they have an innate susceptibility to fire damage due to their frosted skin, and have a lower melting point than regular human epidermis's. They are given instant damage when walking in fire or lava blocks.

**Subzero Resistances -** As a race of ice, the chill air and negative temperature of Glacium water of have little to no effect. The wither effects in Glacium water do not affect Frostkin.

### Lore

Frostkin are an ancient people occupying the Glacium dimension. Arguably, the Frostkin have one of the richest and most complex histories out of all of the other sentient species descending from the common Pax ancestor. Unfortunately, recordings of the vast portion of such events has been lost to the eras gone by.

#### Appearance/physiology

Frostkin have white hair and blue-ish tinted skin. They have a mean population height of about 6' 6'', and possess bony protrusions on areas of the face and body. They have grey colored eyes with pupils that bend in well with the rest of the eye coloration, giving a glassy-looking appearance. They possess dark blue blood containing both hemoglobin and hemocyanin blood proteins. They also seem to be incapable of accumulating lactic acid within muscle tissues, being resistant to the muscle fatigue, cramping, and burning sensations typically experienced during intense physical exercise. Historical records reveal massive differences in Frostkin biology from even as recently as a few thousand years ago. These incredibly rapid adaptations suggest the Scholar was likely directly involved in their changing appearances thought the millennia.

#### History

Despite efforts from the Scholar to obscure information known about Glacium's past, advanced technologies have been unearthed from layers of sediment deep beneath miles of ice and snow verifying the existence of multiple once-powerful societies. The remains of vehicles believed to be capable of achieving sustained flight have been collected from a minimum of at least eight unique times thought Glacium's past. Furthermore, the estimated time spanning between such relics is almost perfectly uniform, indicating cyclical patterns of technological growth, prosperity, stagnation, and collapse.

#### Affinity for Order

Most Frostkin believe that the universe is filled with a very large, but ultimately finite amount of knowledge. Furthermore, their philosophy ascertains that all knowledge in the universe is obtainable if given enough time to accumulate. It is this pursuit of one's ultimate understanding of the universe that drives many Froskin to value order and organization as the ends that justify all means. However, following the disappearance of the Scholar, Frostkin societies have splintered into fragmented totalitarian city states, each with their own "objective" understanding of the universe as they see it.
