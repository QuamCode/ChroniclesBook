# ðŸ§‘ Villagers

### Villager NPC's

You can purchase - through the use of materials and Building Permits - special NPC's from the Camp. These can range from Normal 'Vanilla' Villagers to custom Villagers with unique trades.

When it comes to 'Vanilla' Villagers the role they play has been significantly enhanced due to their rarity. Each Profession has a functional role within your Nation.

### Professions

#### _- Butcher_

Butchers will periodically kill nearby farm animals. They will only kill an animal if they see 2 other animals of the same type nearby.

Applicable Animals:

* Cow
* Mooshroom
* Sheep
* Pig
* Chicken
* Rabbit

#### _- Cleric_

The cleric plays an important role in any community! They have 2 tasks they will perform regardless of the time of day.

The first is **blessing**. Whenever a player prays (sneaks) near a cleric, the cleric will remove most negative effects, and will bestow conditional positive effects. For example, fire resistance if the player is on fire, slow falling if the player is falling, regeneration if the player is low, etc.

Secondly, clerics will also attempt to cure nearby zombie villagers. Note that the process still takes time like normal, so be sure to keep your clerics safe!

#### _- Fisherman_

Fishermen villagers will, well, fish! They will periodically kill nearby aquatic mobs and bring the items they drop at their feet.

#### _- Leatherworker_

Leatherworkers will regularly craft and place saddles on nearby saddle-able mobs. This includes all types of horse variants, pigs, and striders.

#### _- Librarian_

Librarians are bookworms at heart. Once a week, they will fill an empty lectern with an enchanted book with random enchantments (Enchantment level is selected randomly from 5-25).

#### _- Mason_

The mason is used to cutting up blocks all day! They will regularly break blocks above nearby stonecutters. Cannot break unbreakable blocks, chests, barrels, or obsidian.

#### _- Shepherd_

The shepherd takes care of his flock! Shepherds will use wheat, carrots, and seeds to breed nearby animals:

* Cow
* Mooshroom
* Sheep
* Pig
* Rabbit
* Chicken

Note that the shepherd needs the correct type of food to breed the corresponding mob. Wheat for cows, carrots for pigs, seeds for chickens, etc.

They will also shear nearby sheep.

#### _- Armorer, Weaponsmith, Toolsmith, Fletcher_

These "smithing" professions will, once a day, repair some of the durability of any corresponding item placed above their work block.

For example, placing an pickaxe above a toolsmith's smithing table will cause him to repair it once a day.

Fully repairing an item may take several days for high-durability items made out of netherite and diamond, but after an item has been repaired once, it will glow and not despawn until a player picks it up. You can check back after several days to retrieve your repaired gear!

Each profession will only repair items related to their profession.
