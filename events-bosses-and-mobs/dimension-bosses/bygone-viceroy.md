# Bygone Viceroy

The Bygone Viceroy is a boss encountered in an underground cave structure located in the [Glacium](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Glacium) glacial mass biome. It is divided into to halves with each half having it's own respective loot. When you first approach it, it will give off a powerful explosion breaking it free from the ice it was encased in. It is immune to fire, lava, and wither effects.

### Description

#### Attacks

When you first approach the boss, it will summon minions to attack you. The Bygone Viceroy mainly attacks using the Frostlock ability periodically. It also does melee damage with the sword it wields which applies the wither affect when you are hit. You only have to defeat one of its halves to kill it.

#### Post-Battle and Loot

Upon beating one of the halves, the other half of the boss will slowly perish. The post-battle loot depends on what half of The Bygone Viceroy you defeat first. If you defeat the top half, you will be rewarded with a beacon, a few diamonds, the Frostlock spellbook, and a few bones. If you defeat the bottom half first, you will be rewarded with the Glacium Glider (a custom elytra that prevents wither), a few bones, and a custom banner. Also, the area in which the boss was incased may contain armor with enchants higher than possible in normal survival and a few diamonds.

### Lore

Wallowing in shame in their personal cave and hotspring, this Viceroy were emissary warriors of the now-lost mod [_The Scholar_](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Scholar\_\(lost\))_._ Once proud [Frostkin](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Frostkin), they have now been reduced to nothing but a husk of their former selves. Viceroy's were another experiment of the Frostkin empire during its golden age right before the Age of Snow. Frostkin scientists found ways to fuse two beings into one singular entity, as inhumane as it might appear on the outside. It took the combined powers of General Vvrakard and his Frostkin wizards to seal them in a wall of ice, still alive. Free them from their shackles and release them to the heavenly realms beyond.
