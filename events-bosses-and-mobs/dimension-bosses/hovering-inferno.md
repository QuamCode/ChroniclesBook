# Hovering Inferno

The Hovering Inferno takes the appearance of a Blaze, but instead of rods, there are four Fire Shields surrounding the boss. In addition, the Hovering Inferno has a bar coming straight down from its head, and the head wears a Ruby Helmet. The Boss fight is activated through the Infernal Altar - a structure found in the Infernal Dunes Biome in the Nether and is a much more intense and varied version of the Blaze King fight.

### Description

#### Attacks

Phase 1 consists of mainly attacks done by the **Hovering Inferno** moving around. Those include shooting skulker bullets, fireballs, fire and fireworks, in wavy but precise patterns around himself. He also has the ability to summon Infernal minions, Evoker fangs and Dune blazes in the arena. Once the **Hovering Inferno'**s health is depleted, the **Hovering Inferno** moves to the second phase.

During Phase 2, the Hovering Inferno's revival, a note block song called "Border of Life" begins to play while the Hovering Inferno teleports to the middle of the arena. During this phase, the **Hovering Inferno** slowly loses health and is invulnerable to attacks by the player. The player needs to survive to win by dodging the two lasers coming from the **Hovering Inferno**, both going clock-wise with one staying at feet-height of the player and the other passing just over the player's head, forcing you to sneak to dodge it, while some Skulker Bullets with the glowing effect are shot by the **Hovering Inferno**.

#### Post-Battle and Loot

After defeating the Boss several unique drops become available. Powerful weapons Firestorm and Trailblazer, Prismatic Shield, Necrotic Shield and the rare item known as the Infernal Feather.
