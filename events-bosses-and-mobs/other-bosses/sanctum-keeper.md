# Sanctum Keeper

Merging an Ominous Pearl from the Corrupted Enderman with blaze powder in a smithing table to create a Eye Of Ender, following its lead, and digging down, find yourself in the home of the Sanctum Keeper, housed in the Sanctum, a deep forgotten underground stronghold housing souls hostage. The Sanctum Keeper activates upon entering its throne room, it'll shoot arrows at you, jump, teleport and even clones itself! When defeated it'll drop the spirit bow, which upon hitting a target splits your arrow shots into a bunch of projectiles.
