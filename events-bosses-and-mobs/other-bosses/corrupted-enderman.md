# Corrupted Enderman

An Enderman, strengthened by the corruptions of The End. It’s slow, but it can fly, go through walls, and gives you wither damage if you get too close!

It’s drop includes an Ominous Pearl, if you merge it with a blaze powder in a Smithing Table, it’ll become an Ominous Eye of Ender, which can be used to locate the Sanctum structure (not the Dimension). Alternatively, it can be combined with a gold block to make a command block, which can be thrown at the wither to convert it into the Ultra Wither boss.

Naturally spawns in the overworld / can be corrupted
