# The Storm

The Storm is a freak Weather-Event taken physical form. Zombies and Skeletons have a 2.5% chance to drop the storm’s summon item, known as the ‘Storm in a Bottle’. The player must use the summon item in an open area above ground in the overworld in order to trigger the event.

Once used, a countdown occurs allocating the player 30 seconds to prepare for the event. After the countdown has occurred, players will face 3 rounds that all last 2 ½ minutes, with each round increasing in difficulty but providing better loot. During these rounds, waves of enemies spawn continuously until the the round ends. These enemies drop custom loot which can only be obtained from the event.

After players have beaten all 3 rounds (7 ½ minutes into the event), the final round occurs. At the centre of the battlefield, a boss is spawned. It is known as ‘The Sentinel of the Storm’ and attacks the player with its powerful bow ‘The eye of the Storm’. The player is sent upwards if hit by its arrows, but if the arrows miss, an angry bolt of lightning strikes the spot where it lands.

This event is to be played at the stage where the player has acquired diamonds but not yet explored the Nether.
