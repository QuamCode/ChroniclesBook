# Blaze King

The Blaze King, found once per world in its tower high above its nether fortress. If you dare awakening it, it'll protect its people by fireballing you, exploding flame fireworks on you, and causing explosions.

When defeated, it'll drop its helmet, which when worn at low health will give you Strength II, giving you high power at your breaking point.

Encountered: In the Blaze Tower in the first fortress you enter.
