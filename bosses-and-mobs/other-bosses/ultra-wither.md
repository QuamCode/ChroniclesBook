# Ultra Wither

Power a spawned wither by dropping an Ominous Command block onto it created from the pearl of a Corrupted Enderman and meet the Ultra Wither, a more powerful version of the existing Wither, it has more health, new attacks, dashing and can summon wither skeletons! This Wither upon defeating will grant you more XP, and a netherite ingot, and of course the nether star.
