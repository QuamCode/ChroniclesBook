# Solatium Thrall

The Solatium Thrall is a boss encountered at the center of the Dormis courtyard structure. The Thrall is resistant to taking damage from arrows, immune to levitation effects, and has the slow falling effect. The Thrall wears a combination of gold and netherite armor pieces and takes no damage from lava or by being on fire.

### Description

#### Attacks

The Thrall's crown is covered by four invisible blazes, capable of discharging fireballs toward targets up to 100 blocks away. Arrows fired at the crown are instantly destroyed. The Thrall periodically summons an area of effect cloud beneath its feet that grants a brief levitation effect to nearby entities, knocking them up in the air. The Thrall also summons smaller mobs to defend itself, namely Fireblights and Blight Riders. Fireblights are large, flying mobs that consistently summon a steam of falling fire blocks beneath themselves but die after a brief period of time. Blight Riders fire flaming arrows and ride the Fireblights; however, they do not take fall damage when their mounts perish due to them having the slow falling effect.

#### Post-Battle & Loot

Upon death, the Solatium Thrall will detonate in a massive fiery explosion. The boss' drops include armor, a knowledge book readied with the worm-toothed burrower ability, and the Thrall's crown. The crown itself is enchanted with projectile protection x100, curse of binding, and grants the wearer copious armor, armor toughness, and knockback resistance abilities modifiers, however, it can break very easily.

### Lore

The Solatium Thrall serves the Mod of Justice (The Judge) and resides within Dormis, caring out justice within the prison dimension, and in rare occasions, bringing a burning vengeance upon other realms. The Thrall performs its service as means of paying off a debt made long ago. However, sources disagree as to the exact origins of the Thrall. Some believe the Thrall may be a surviving member of a primordial race, extending well before that of the age of Mods. Others still, think it may have been an ordinary mortal, albeit one granted with immense power. Regardless of whatever has been theorized, the Thrall's fire-based attacks, in combination with its affinity for destruction, allude to The Tyrants's close involvement.
