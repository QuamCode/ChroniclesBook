# The Disruptor

The Disruptor is a boss using an elder guardian model encountered in the Living Palace structure in the Omnidrome dimension's BIOME 1. The structure is found on very high levels, and its boss arena is located in the back. It is immune to wither effects and capable of flight. It benefits from a unique movement system that allows it to fly around the player in sporadic patterns.&#x20;

It is recommended to have powerful gear before fighting The Disruptor, as the boss can sometimes even one shot full Netherite with attacks such as the slam attack. Extreme caution is advised if undergeared.

### Attacks

When you first approach The Disruptor it will give off an explosion. Then it will proceed to cycle through several different attacks such as:

* Slamming into the ground near player from above.
* Firing off a series of green lasers in rapid succession.
* Summoning strong endermites to distract the player.
* And dropping explosive ender eye bombs that create green explosions overhead.

### Post-Battle and Loot

After defeating The Disruptor, you will be rewarded with:

1. An unrecognizable item name, codename Void Bomb. It is a horizontal area of effect item that gives blinding, sickness, wither, invisibility, and many other debuffs for a brief period of time. The effects are constantly applied as long as you are in its area of effect. It is recommended to use this item and then run away as it can affect the main user as well.
2. The Great Nullifier magic book, ironically a decent counter to the void bomb. Check the Magic Books page to see what it does. _(Can be finicky functionality-wise in multiplayer)_
3. A nerfed version of the Overpowered Admin weapon, [Null](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Overpowered\_Admin\_Weapons). In the offhand it gives 11+ attack speed and 11+ luck, nearly giving a sword pre-combat rework status. It can also function as a powerful fishing rod. Its item description is binary code, and can be translated.
4. Observant players can locate four end portals complete with all end portal frames at the top of the arena inside of the chandelier. These can serve as actual end portals, and can be another way to enter The End without having to find a stronghold. Note that you will still need the necessary ender eyes to insert in said portal frames.\


### Lore

The Disruptor served as the main sentinel of The Living Palace before its corruption at the hands of The End. It was once the pride of Omnitech technologies for the time, destroying any sort of attempt of The End to spread its influence and grab ahold of the dimensional fabrics of The Omnidrome while The Ascended Council was creating its first tests of combining Void and End powers to create Glitchtech. Before it was known as The Disruptor, it was aptly named Firewall. However, over time, despite Firewall's initial successes, the powerful corrupting energies of The End grew too much for it to handle, and it became another chess piece in The End's great game over the Omnidrome. It was such a menace that The Council had no choice but to seal away what was now The Disruptor in the chamber of the original Void and End testing site.

#### The Living Palace

The Living Palace was at one time a testing ground for new technologies. A fusion of Omnitech and an enitre unknown void creature pulled from the depths, at the time the palace was the magnum opus of the Omnidrome, it's crowning jewel. This was the place where Glitchtech was concieved, as the Council somehow gained access to multiple end portals, bringing in as much of the corrupting energy as they wanted. The Void creature, for a small amount of time, was able to suppress The End's encroaching tendrils from seeping outside of the palace as it held onto the testing chamber with its jaws. That, combined with the creation of Firewall, prevented the Omnidrome's slow rot from the inside.

Yet, with any recorded instance of tampering with the End's power, it was only a matter of time before things fell apart. As The Council approved more and more testing, and as they crept closer and closer to Glitchtech, the beast began to die. Their solution was only temporary, and by the time they had perfected Glitchtech, the void creature had passed away. This led to an explosion of End energy leaking into the Omnidrome, eventually corrupting and repurposing the palace. As of now, slow ruination is creeping into the dimension, as it shall inevitably fall in the decades to come, ironically much like the current state of [Sanctum](https://thebrackenpack.fandom.com/wiki/Sanctum), The Ascended Council's long and forgotten cursed legacy.
