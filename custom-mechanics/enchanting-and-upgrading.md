# üßô‚ôÇ Enchanting & Upgrading

* **New Items**
  * Guide book: Get it by throwing a book and quill on top of an enchanting table.
  * Charged Bookshelf: Used to increase the enchanting setup Tiers
  * Technical Anvil: Used to merge or extract custom enchantments and curses
  * Polished Lapis: Currency to trade with an Advanced Enchanter
  * Isolated Core: Rare item to remove custom and vanilla curses
  * Blessed Orb: Item to convert a mob into an enchanted one

* **Enchanting Setup**

You can place charged bookshelves around the enchanting table from 2 to 5 blocks to increase it's Tier. Each time you level it up it will change the Enchanting table a bit. Like Adding hovering Lapis on top of it.

_Tier 1_: Allowed to get Low enchantments only ---requirements---> 12 levels

_Tier 2_: Allowed to get Average enchantments ---requirements---> 24 levels

_Tier 3_: Allowed to get Strong enchantments ---requirements---> 36 levels

_Tier 4_: Convert Pages of Power into an enchanted book

_Tier 5_: Avoid using from 3 to 7 base charge points

***

* **Base Charge**

Before start enchanting you need to charge your enchanting table. Each Tier increase the max capacity that the enchanting table supports by 100.

You can check how many charge is available by _sneaking_ near the enchanting table.

In order to increase the base charge, you just need to throw some lapis on the enchanting table. Each time you do this, the charge will increase 3 units per lapis lazuli. However you can change how much charge is added as well as which item is required to increase the base charge with the Config Menu.

Each enchantment consumes a different amount of base charge and will consume even more if the enchantment has a higher level.

***

Your skill in enchanting determines how many levels are added or removed from your enchantments. This also affects the anvil, as you won't be able to combine enchantments to get higher levels either.

**This means that at the start, your enchantments will look something like this:**\

**But as you level up enchanting, they may look closer to this:**\

You may further amplify your enchanting skill using potions, [Brewing ](brewing-and-alchemy.md)features a new potion recipe that boosts your enchanting skill further.

## Tips

Enchanting EXP is determined by the enchantments you get, how rare they are, and their levels. Rare enchantments will grant far more experience than common ones.

If you're looking to level up cheaply, I suggest not going for the 3rd rank enchantments in the enchantment table. Especially in early game you would be spending a lot of enchanting experience for not a lot of gain. The 1st and 2nd rank are much more worth to use in terms of leveling.

Items that can possess a lot of enchantments are best for leveling enchanting, items such as gold boots or gold swords are more likely to get more, and stronger enchantments and thus more exp.

## Upgrades

Upgrades are different from regular enchantments in that they can't be combined with each other to make them stronger, they can't be removed with a grindstone, and they're instead obtained through crafting recipes. However, they do benefit from the enchanting skill and grant some experience when crafted. These upgrades are unlocked as you progress through enchanting.

Upgrades become stronger as you progress through enchanting.
