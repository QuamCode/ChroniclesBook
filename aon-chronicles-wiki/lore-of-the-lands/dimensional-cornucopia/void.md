# Void

A hollowed out, huge version of the void is accessible via digging down to the lowest point in Sanctum. Slow falling, and blindness are applied to any who enter The Void. Beware the sounds of unknowable creatures as you descend down to The End.

Falling far enough is an alternate method to get into the end dimension, although to fight the ender dragon you will likely need to travel a long distance to 0, 0.

### Lore

The Void is a dimension of pure nothingness, and the origin of the universe before it was put together with a purpose. Much of the space in between dimensions is occupied by void. As such, there is no mod currently occupying the void as we speak. However, there are great creatures that swim deep within the void like an ocean. Some say the Void is the nexus place of damned Souls and Celestial creatures beyond imagination, incomparable in size and power to any other creature within the 14 dimensions. Luckily they tend to avoid any race that comes down to "explore".&#x20;

With that being said, exploration is nearly impossible, as those that enter the void forget their journey when the return to another dimension. They know they've taken it, but do not remember any details. Even Mods and Moddesses usually avoid this dimension for unknown reasons, despite them being immune to the amnesia. Even then, there have been instances of multiple Mods that were brave enough to harness powers, creatures, and great knowledge from the void. The best known example of this was [The Traveler](../mods-and-gods/the-traveler.md#innominatam-the-cosmic-tunneller), who through his companionship with the void worm Innominatam, was able to glimpse furthur into the void than any other Mod, cementing him in legend. He has not revealed any of the information he learned within the void, but some believe that it was the key to building his [Varskspace](glacium-panacea-the-brine-varskspace.md#varskspace) dimension.

However, over time [The Ascended Council](../mods-and-gods/the-ascended-council.md) has found ways of traversing around this effect for the Automech people by inventing personal portals into the Void, tearing a rift in the dimensional fabrics beyond what was capable before to avoid the dimensional amnesia. As such, by combining the strange powers found deep within the Void as well as The End, they were able to create Glitchtech, a powerful and highly corrosive offensive force that some Automechs and automech creations use for warfare. This would inevitably factor into the The End's slow corruption in The Omnidrome, which started with portals to the End and Void in the Omni _Living Palace_.
