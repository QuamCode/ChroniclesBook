# The Underdark

The Underdark is the cave dimension and is a great place to locate diamonds, rubies, gold and more. A more expansive open cave system is located near the top of the dimension, with more ores in the upper limits of the realm as opposed to the smaller cave systems down below. Small patches of Blackstone and bedrock lines the walls, floors and ceilings of the area.

Accessing the Underdark is accessed by digging to bedrock level in the Overworld.

Be wary of entering The Nether dimension through The Underdark as you will have to traverse down from the Build Limit. Because of this it is recommended to have some obsidian, a lightning book, or some other way of leaving the nether before going down.
