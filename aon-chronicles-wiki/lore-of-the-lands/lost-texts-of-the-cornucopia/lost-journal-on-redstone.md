# Lost Journal on Redstone

#### The 5th of Iunius

Redstone is a fascinating, curious substance. A small pile of the crimson dust does little to nothing to provide energy, but when large enough amounts of it are compressed, it becomes a force to be reckoned with. The energy it produces never ceases, providing a piece of machinery continuous power indefinitely. Despite this, the Council refuses to look into this matter because of their ever inflated egos. Because they see the Dwellers as inferior in intellect, the Council blind themselves to the possibility that others could ever do something resourceful and intelligent. They claim that it would weaken us if we had to depend on the Dwellers for energy, but the truth is they want to keep their monopoly on expensive modifications. Redstone is beyond abundant in the Underdark and its price would be almost insignificant. I devised a way to compress the precious resource without decreasing its power output, creating energy dense stones that can fit in the palm of your hand. I call them ‘Crystallos’ and they have successfully been powering my right arm and left leg for the past three weeks. I also have seen vastly improved performance to Crystallum energy compared to traditional methods, including increased agility. If all goes well, this will allow for cheap, continuous energy that will surely lead us to a brighter future. I shall display my results in the next meeting. The others will never change their minds, but perhaps he will see the possibilities and be forced to step in. Like all those years long ago…

Until then,
