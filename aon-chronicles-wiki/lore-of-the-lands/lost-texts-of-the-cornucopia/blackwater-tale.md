# Blackwater Tale

I let myself drift into murky waters,

Slip into a glistening broth.

The sea calls us to dive in further

For family we must locate below.

\
Wade closer to the darker bottom,

A hole of hollow and deep cold.

Perhaps I’ve slipped far into yonder

Beyond the reach of family’s warm touch.

\
A shrill cry in the deepwater

From creatures whose throats are not my own.

A place meant for no Nereid or any in Brine.

A place of terror and unfathomable dark.

\
Where void and water meet,

Where light’s existence is null,

Where family go to die and wither

The blackwater down below.
