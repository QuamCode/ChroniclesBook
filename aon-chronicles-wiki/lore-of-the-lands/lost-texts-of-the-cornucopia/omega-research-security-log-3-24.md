EXPERIMENT #2495-89 is an experiment for a potential emissary for The Council. This “emissary” would help proclaim the will of The Ascended Council interdimensionally. To make her more approachable, she will be implanted with emotions, feelings, gender, and pain similar to regular humanoid creatures. Her appearance will also resemble a human more closely.
```
{% endcode %}

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
In addition to her emotions and appearance, she will be equipped with a prototype Omnitech that functions efficiently outside of The Omnidrome in its raw form. This Omnitech has the same power as Omnitech inside of the Omnidrome, and its success could see a potential Golden Age under The Council. Success of the female specimen may alter the appearance of Automechs forever. Success is of the utmost importance in this experiment, as failure may push further advances back even more.

<mark style="color:green;">Retrieval of the prototype has thus proven unsuccessful. This was most likely spurred on by several failings on the side of the security administration. They are as follows:</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">FAILING 1: Pain tests were not properly secured, torture experiment rooms walls were not reinforced with soundwave absorbing Omnitech materials. Culprit most likely picked up the soundwaves from EXP #2495-89’s screams from a remote device.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">FAILING 2: The prototype omnitech used on 2495-89’s mainframe was to be kept as a secret deeper within the ranks of the laboratory. This information most likely leaked to the outside through word of mouth. We are considering that an Outlander is disguising as one of our Automechs on the inside. Investigations are currently being conducted.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">FAILING 3: Despite security protocols, I believe many of the ones currently under place for experiment 2495-89 were vastly insufficient given the importance of this specimen.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">We assume the culprit was none other than THE\_HEMLOCK. Magipholic tech discharges were discovered along multiple areas of the facility, which are universally known to be used by THE\_HEMLOCK and her followers. I recommend we immediately begin research on ways we can apprend The Hemlock. She has caused countless damage and deaths within our ranks, and I believe The Council has had enough.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Send recommendation to Enigma Analysts and OMEGA\_RESEARCH facility</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">\_-\_-\_ SEND RECOMMENDATION: DEVELOP METHOD TO APPREND/KILL THE\_HEMLOCK? \_-\_-\_</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Yes</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">- - - RECOMMENDATION SENT - - -</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">In the meantime, this experiment can’t cease. We are on the verge of weaponizing this tech.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Begin research on Experiment 2495-89-1: this time a male counterpart.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">We cannot afford any more failures.</mark>
