# ⚛ Mods and Gods

Within each dimension within the Cornucopia there was a respective Mod or Moddess - the 'Gods' of Chronicles. Here you can find some in depth details about all the mods, and their backstories.&#x20;

> _"The 'gods', mods and moddesses govern each dimension and help stabilize and take care of their people. They are the only thing staving away the corruption of evil forces, or the encroaching darkness of the Void."_

There were 11 Mods in the age of memoryless time - although few remain in the current Era.
