# The Entertainer

Across the ages, poets, painters, and artists of every kind have looked to the Entertainer as the ultimate muse and source of artistic inspiration. More gregarious than any other Mod, the Entertainer spends the majority of her time with mortals and is motivated by a genuine desire to encourage everyone she meets to enjoy life with gusto, chase away boredom, embrace adventure, and hone one’s talents for the betterment of all.

#### Described appearance

Little can be stated regarding the appearance of the Entertainer that has not been described ad nauseum in countless other works throughout time. Sculptures of the Mod are commonplace in civilizations both past and present. Volumes of poems have been written solely on describing singular aspects of the Mod’s appearance, such as her eyes, wings, or hair.

For the sake of maintaining brevity; however, it can be generally understood that the Entertainer resembles a tall, winged, Faefolk woman. She possesses long pointed ears and blue tattooed skin, as well as dark weightless hair that operates as if a gentle wind is blowing past it. Her skin and large eyes produce a faint, colored light that changes depending on the season of the year or the relative lighting of the environment. Her entire form can change from being opaque to completely transparent. Often accompanying the Entertainer are the faint sounds of chimes or tiny bells ringing, or rarely, a faint chorus of voices. Although it is overwhelmingly accepted that the Entertainer has feathery, ivory-colored wings, certain antagonistic depictions of her have been unearthed including the portrayal of barbed, bat-like wings.

#### Relationships and History

The Entertainer thrives on improving the emotional state of those around her, other Mods included. Through the accounts of several “forbidden historians,” It can be understood that there were multiple instances in history in which the Entertainer was solely responsible for keeping reality itself intact by maintaining the peace between Mods. The specific mentions of certain procedures and laws within the fractal codes also appear to support this claim.

Although she was unable to keep the Traveler from leaving the group initially, legend says that it was her singing that somehow reached the Traveler deep in the Void and led him back to the mortal realms.

Of all the Mods; however, it is with the Forger that the Entertainer has had the closest relationship. Before the memoryless times, and well before the age of light, eons in fact, before they had encountered any other Mods, the Entertainer and the Forger found each other wandering in the Void. Knowing only of the darkness and of the monsters dwelling in darkness, both had never met another being quite so similar to themselves before. After meeting, they created secret names for each other which have remained unspoken by any other Mod or mortal down to this day.

After understanding how fragile a mortal’s life is, the Entertainer has shifted her priorities toward improving the lives of mortals, however fleeting they may be. Although she still bears much responsibility for keeping the peace between other Mods, it is generally believed that the volatility of the Mods has decreased with time and as such, her role as a mediator has become less used.

#### The intent behind Experience Points

Boredom and inactivity are two of the Entertainer’s greatest foes. As a means of incentivizing mortals across all realms to seek out adventure, she completely split herself into scattered fragments of her power throughout the entirety of the cornucopia as a reward for those who mine, smelt, trade, or otherwise go out and experience life. These experience points, in turn, can then be collected and used as a kind of currency for wielding power. &#x20;
