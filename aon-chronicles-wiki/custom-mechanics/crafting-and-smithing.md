# üî® Crafting & Smithing

You may have noticed many regular recipes no longer work, and the ones that do are a bit weaker. This is because they now require a little bit more work to be made.

> ‚ùó  **Each "tier" of materials has an intended **_**smithing**_** level of usage.**

* Before this level, tools made of these materials will be _**worse**_ than vanilla.
* After this level, they will be _**better**_ than vanilla.
* IF you invest a skill point in its respective tier, in the **/skills** menu.\
  The further under this level you are, the worse items will be!

| Tier                 | Smithing Level |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| I) Wood/Leather:     | level 0        |
| II) Stone/Chainmail: | level 20       |
| III) Gold/Iron:      |  level 40      |
| IV) Diamond:         |  level 60      |
| V) Netherite:        |  level 80      |

***

Smithing is your proficiency in tool/armor making. The higher quality equipment you make, the better their properties.\
These properties can include armor value, durability, damage, attack speed, and projectile velocity.&#x20;

**How to gain EXP**\
Crafting any tool or equipment. The more expensive the material and the more of it spent, the more EXP you get.

**Special Notes**\
Crafting tools with materials far above your level will decrease the experience gained from it, as well as crafting with materials too far below your level.

> ‚ùó For each tier apart, EXP is halved. (e.g. at level 40(iron/gold tier), stone and diamond are halved, wood and netherite are quartered)

Equipment gets a grading when it's crafted, which is based on the quality.\
Quality is determined by adding your general skill to your proficiency with a certain material.\
0-49 = **Poor**\
50-99 = **Decent**\
100-149 = **Great**\
150-199 = **Epic**\
200-249 = **Legendary**\
250-299 = _**Divine**_\
300+ = _**Incomprehensible**_

> ‚ùó **Iron, Gold, Diamond, and Netherite now requires a slight change to ingredients**

Gold and Iron need to be heated in a furnace/blast furnace first.\
Metals become more malleable as they're heated up, allowing them to be forged in more useful items.\

Diamond needs to be made unstable first, as its usual stable crystalline structure makes it impossible to form.

\
Likewise, Netherite being a metal also needs to be heated. However, Netherite needs much more heat to be forge-able, and a soul-campfire or blast furnace can accomplish this.\

## Upgrading Items

You might notice your items are, despite being of pretty good quality, are still pretty mediocre. This is because you've not finished them yet.

All metallic, diamond, and stone items can be heated up and then cooled down. This tempers the item and greatly improves durability. The higher the item's quality, the greater the effect of these upgrades.

Cooling is done by throwing the item into a water-filled cauldron.

Wooden and leather items (including bows and fishing rods) can be made more durable by _waxing_ the wood using **melted wax** ![](../../.gitbook/assets/melted\_wax.png).\
To craft this, take honeycomb and put it in a furnace (or similar) and combine the **melted wax** ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/melted\_wax (1).png>)with your item of choice.\
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35800803/222100912-1a225d50-21bc-4818-b99a-889445e45aba.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35800803/222101251-2fdf3bf6-bf57-4cf4-8562-a58d11f0ae40.png)\
Most upgrades are done in a similar fashion, where you combine your item with another one to improve it some more.&#x20;

Armors when you just craft them are sort of crude and don't fit your body well, so you can fit them by adding extra material like so. This will improve the armor and toughness value.\

Forged weapons aren't very sharp when you just made them, and so you can combine them with a **sharpening stone** ![](../../.gitbook/assets/sharpening\_stone.png) to sharpen them.\
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35800803/222107497-f499b528-3d44-4604-9530-e14deb6affb9.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35800803/222107628-408c1e03-9ab5-47f5-9c71-e41ccbe35529.png)\
After they've been sharpened, you can polish them with a **polishing stone** ![](../../.gitbook/assets/polishing\_stone.png)to get them as sharp as possible.\
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35800803/222108252-cee8a507-07f5-4be0-8d71-80294ea44949.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35800803/222108439-fb2faff8-af3c-4f7b-b47d-788debc7f12e.png)\


The handle is still pretty crude, so to make it feel better you can bind it in leather. This will improve attack speed.\

You can reinforce the bowstring on bows and crossbows to make arrows shot from them faster.
