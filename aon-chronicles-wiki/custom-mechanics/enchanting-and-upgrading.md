# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Enchanting & Upgrading

> ‚ùó Unlike Alchemy, there are no limitations in which enchantments you can and can't get. There are certain item upgrades related to enchanting, though, which do need to be unlocked.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are many new and strange Enchantments available to Discover using the Runic Infusion Table
{% endhint %}

* **New Items**
  * Charged Bookshelf: Used to increase the enchanting setup Tiers

* **Enchanting Setup**

You can place charged bookshelves around the enchanting table from 2 to 5 blocks to increase it's Tier. Each time you level it up it will change the Enchanting table a bit. Like Adding hovering Lapis on top of it.

_Tier 1_: Allowed to get Low enchantments only ---requirements---> 12 levels

_Tier 2_: Allowed to get Average enchantments ---requirements---> 24 levels

_Tier 3_: Allowed to get Strong enchantments ---requirements---> 36 levels

_Tier 4_: Convert Pages of Power into an enchanted book

_Tier 5_: Avoid using from 3 to 7 base charge points



***

Enchanting does not change which enchantments you get, instead it only changes the levels you get with said enchantments and those are calculated based on your Enchanting quality stat.

At 120 quality all enchantments are back to vanilla strengths.

This means that when you first start playing, every efficiency enchantment you get for example will be 2 levels weaker than it would have been in vanilla, and every 60 enchanting quality you get afterwards will further increase your efficiency levels by 1.

### How to gain Enchanting quality

Leveling up grants you 1.5 Enchanting quality to your items, up to 150 at level 100.

The Enchanting skill tree (see /skills) has perks granting a total of 150 Enchanting quality.

So leveling to 100 alone grants you a total of 300 Enchanting quality, but there are ways to push past this.

You can reset Enchanting and enter NewGame+, granting you a permanent +50 quality per loop, for a total of +100 should you choose to do this twice.

Leveling Woodcutting eventually grants you access to Crystal Apples, which give you +50 Enchanting quality (among other things) for 30 seconds when eaten.

That means you can accumulate a total of 450 Enchanting quality assuming the default configuration.

Your skill in enchanting determines how many levels are added or removed from your enchantments. This also affects the anvil, as you won't be able to combine enchantments to get higher levels either.

**This means that at the start, your enchantments will look something like this:**\
