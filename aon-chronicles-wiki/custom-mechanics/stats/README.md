| Healing                      | Scalar        | `1.0`   | Multiplies any healing gained                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Hunger Consumption Reduction | Chance/Scalar | `0.0`   | üçÄ If positive, acts as a chance to not spend hunger whenever you get hungrier. If negative, acts as a multiplier for the hunger you lost                                                                                                               |

| Crafting Speed               | Scalar        | `0.0`   | Speeds up crafting for the "immersive" recipe type. The Lite configuration will not have any of these recipes, and so this stat does nothing. `time = baseTime * (1 / 1 + value)`                                                                       |

| Durability                   | Scalar        | `0.0`   | Effectively adds a chance to not spend durability similarly to how Unbreaking works, `chance = 1 / 1 + value`                                                                                                                                           |

| Jump Height                  | Scalar        | `1.0`   | Acts as a multiplier for jump height. It is known that this tends to act a little strangely, there is not much I can do against this as it is lag-related, but with 1.20.5 adding a jump height attribute this should be a lot smoother in that version |
| Multi-Jumps                  | Value         | `0`     | Allows jumping multiple times in mid-air, requires double-tapping spacebar to jump. If you have not spent all your jumps before landing, you will not take fall damage                                                                                  |
