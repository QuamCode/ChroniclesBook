#### _- Armorer, Weaponsmith, Toolsmith, Fletcher_

These "smithing" professions will, once a day, repair some of the durability of any corresponding item placed above their work block.

For example, placing an pickaxe above a toolsmith's smithing table will cause him to repair it once a day.

Fully repairing an item may take several days for high-durability items made out of Netherite and diamond, but after an item has been repaired once, it will glow and not despawn until a player picks it up. You can check back after several days to retrieve your repaired gear!

Each profession will only repair items related to their profession.
