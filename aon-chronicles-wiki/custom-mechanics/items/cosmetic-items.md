# ðŸŽ¨ Cosmetic Items

By simply naming a specific Item in an Anvil you can produce a myriad of cosmetic items that inherit the qualities of the original Item. This can range from themed Armour, Historical or Popular Culture Weapons, Consumables, Food etc.

The sheer number of available custom-textures is massive. Much too large to include here on a single WiKi page.

I'd recommend speaking to `Balok` at The Camp who will show you some options for common items.
