# ⚗️ Brewing & Alchemy

Brewing mostly works the same as in vanilla, except a lot of recipes are temporarily locked off to the player and your brewed potions will be a lot weaker at the start. Potions still use an Awkward Potion as base, with the exception of Weakness Potions where this is optional.

Alchemy is your proficiency in potion brewing. The higher your skill in alchemy, the more powerful your potions are able to get. Using alchemy, you can brew potions much stronger than what you can attain in vanilla, as well as completely new potion effects.

**How to gain EXP**\
You get experience through potion brewing. You gain experience for every potion you brew, based on how rare the ingredient is. For example, using a ghast tear rewards much more exp than rotten flesh.

**Special Notes**\
If you're committed to leveling alchemy, you're bound to brew a lot of potions you don't need. You can quickly empty bottles if you click with them on a cauldron.\


Potions get a grading when it's brewed, which is based on the quality.\
Quality is determined by adding your general skill to your proficiency with either beneficial potions or poisons.\
0-49 = **Rancid**\
50-99 = **Tainted**\
100-149 = **Dirty**\
150-199 = **Cloudy**\
200-249 = **Clear**\
250-299 = _**Refined**_\
300+ = _**Pure**_
