# ‚öóÔ∏è Brewing & Alchemy

Brewing mostly works the same as in vanilla, except a lot of recipes are temporarily locked off to the player and your brewed potions will be a lot weaker at the start. Potions still use an Awkward Potion as base, with the exception of Weakness Potions where this is optional.

Alchemy is your proficiency in potion brewing. The higher your skill in alchemy, the more powerful your potions are able to get. Using alchemy, you can brew potions much stronger than what you can attain in vanilla, as well as completely new potion effects.\


Potions get a grading when it's brewed, which is based on the quality.\
Quality is determined by adding your general skill to your proficiency with either beneficial potions or poisons.\
0-49 = **Rancid**\
50-99 = **Tainted**\
100-149 = **Dirty**\
150-199 = **Cloudy**\
200-249 = **Clear**\
250-299 = _**Refined**_\
300+ = _**Pure**_

Brewing any potion will grant it a quality value. This quality value is equal to your generic Alchemy quality stat PLUS your Alchemy quality stat for if the potion is beneficial or a poison.

Duration and amplifier ranges will always be from 0-300 quality.

### How to gain Alchemy quality

Leveling up grants you `1.5` Alchemy quality to your potions, up to `150` at level 100.

The Alchemy skill tree (see /skills) has one perk granting `+50` generic quality, and four perks each granting a total of `+50` to beneficial potion quality and poison quality, adding up to `+100` for buffs/debuffs.

The only potion effect types _not_ affected by buff/debuff quality are BAD\_OMEN, SLOW\_FALLING, and GLOWING, since they are neutral effects. Because of this, the max quality for these effects will be lower than the others.

So leveling to 100 alone grants you a total of `250` Alchemy quality, but there are ways to push past this.

You can reset Alchemy and enter NewGame+, granting you a permanent `+50` quality per loop, for a total of +100 should you choose to do this twice.

Leveling Woodcutting eventually grants you access to Crystal Apples, which give you `+50` Alchemy quality (among other things) for 30 seconds when eaten.

If EnchantsSquared happens to be installed, it adds the "Alchemic Fortitude" enchantment which (at max level 3) grants another `+50` Alchemy quality.

That means you can accumulate a total of `450` Alchemy quality assuming the default configuration. The plugin was balanced around 300 being the assumed max, so you can get some pretty overpowered potions doing this.

### Transmutation

Transmutation is done by brewing Draught of Midas, which is brewed using a Nether Star + Awkward Potion.\
It's a splash potion that changes block materials when thrown. It transmutes everything in a 2-block radius and only transmutes blocks that are touching air.

Reactions:

* `Oak Log > Birch Log > Spruce Log > Dark Oak Log > Jungle Log > Acacia Log > Oak Log` (same with planks, woods)
* `Crimson Stem > Warped Stem > Crimson Stem`
* `Stone > Copper Ore > Iron Ore`
* `Redstone Block > Lapis Lazuli Block > Redstone Block`
* `Brown Mushroom > Red Mushroom > Brown Mushroom`
* `Crimson Fungus > Warped Fungus > Crimson Fungus`
* `Wheat > Potatoes > Carrots > Beetroots > Wheat`
* `Melon > Pumpkin > Melon`
* `Dirt > Sand > Red Sand > Gravel > Clay > Dirt`
* `Grass Block > Mycelium > Grass Block`
* `Grass > Warped Roots > Crimson roots > Grass`
* `Netherrack > Coarse Dirt > Netherrack`
* `Cobblestone > Mossy Cobblestone > Cobblestone`
* `Obsidian > Crying Obsidian > Obsidian`
* `Torch > Soul Torch > Torch`
* `Copper Block > Iron Block > Gold Block` (same with ores and raw ore blocks)
* `Emerald Block > Diamond Block > Emerald Block` (same with ores)
