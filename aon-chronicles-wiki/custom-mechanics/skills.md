# 🔺 Skills

{% hint style="info" %}
Chronicles features 14 skills natively you can level up. Each skill has a skill tree, populated with perks you can unlock to gain specific bonuses.
{% endhint %}

## NewGame+

Each skill (except power) has an additional perk that allows you to reset that skill. In exchange you get some permanent stats for that skill and you get your skill points refunded, but also have EXP gain for that skill reduced a bit so your next run will be a bit harder. This also allows for a higher power level since you get to level skills again.\
This is known as New Game+ (NG)

***

## Power 💥

> Power represents the player's total progression.

**How to gain EXP**\
Leveling any skill other than Power gives you some power experience.

**Special Notes**\
Leveling up in Power is the only way to get **Skill Points**, which are needed to unlock perks. ((unless your server has implemented alternative methods to get skill points))

**Perks**\
The Power skill mostly just offers generic stat improvements, such as Luck, Damage, Health Regeneration, etc.

## Smithing 🛠

See [Crafting & Smithing](crafting-and-smithing.md)

> Smithing is your proficiency in tool/armor making. The higher quality equipment you make, the better their properties. These properties can include armor value, durability, damage, attack speed, and projectile velocity. Potentially others if your server has configured it so.

**How to gain EXP**\
Crafting any tool or equipment. The more expensive the material and the more of it spent, the more EXP you get.

**Special Notes**\
Crafting tools with materials far above your level will decrease the experience gained from it, as well as crafting with materials too far below your level.\
\
The only exception to this rule is that at level 80 (Netherite tier), diamond equipment does NOT halve in value.

> ❗ For each "tier" apart, EXP is halved. (e.g. at level 40(iron/gold tier), stone and diamond are halved, wood and netherite are quartered)

**Tips**\
Smithing is a resource-expensive skill to level up, but the first levels go by fast. To reach level 40 (iron/gold tier) you need approximately 1 stack of logs and 3 stacks of cobblestone, spent on crafting tools.

**Perks**\
Smithing only offers generic quality improvements for your crafted equipment, as well as a couple new recipes. Leveling Smithing allows you to craft your own Tridents and Elytras.

## Enchanting 🎇

See [Enchanting](enchanting-and-upgrading.md)

> Enchanting is your proficiency in... Enchanting. The higher your skill in enchanting, the higher enchantment levels you are able to achieve. Eventually, your enchantments will break vanilla boundaries.

**How to gain EXP**\
You get experience through enchanting items. EXP is based on the rarity of these enchantments and their level. For example, Thorns III gives far more experience than Sharpness III.\
You also get higher experience for higher levels. For example, getting Sharpness I three times rewards less EXP than getting Sharpness III in 1 go.\
Lastly, you get experience for each EXP orb you spent.

**Tips**\
Even level 30 enchantments will have their strength greatly reduced, and so it is not recommended to level enchanting with 3rd level enchantments in the early game.\
To save on experience, I recommend using 1st-2nd level enchantments until around level 50-ish.

**Perks**\
Enchanting offers general skill improvements allowing you to get higher enchantments, as well as some utility stats like Experience Consumption Reduction (spend less EXP while enchanting), Lapis Consumption Reduction, Skill EXP Increase, Experience Orb Increase, etc.

## Alchemy ⚗

See [Alchemy](brewing-and-alchemy.md)

> Alchemy is your proficiency in potion brewing. The higher your alchemy skill, the more powerful your potions can get. Using alchemy you can brew potions much stronger than what you can attain in vanilla.

There are two new potion recipes for two other vanilla potion effects:&#x20;

Health Boost and Haste.

\
`Health Boost = Awkward Potion + Sweet Berries`

`Haste = Awkward Potion + Nether Quartz`

**How to gain EXP**\
You get experience through potion brewing. You gain experience for every potion you brew, based on how rare the ingredient is. For example, using a ghast tear rewards much more exp than sugar. This process may be automated using hoppers, as long as the person last having placed- or interacted with the brewing stand is online.

**Special Notes**\
If you're committed to leveling alchemy you're bound to brew a lot of potions you don't need. You can quickly empty bottles if you click with them on a cauldron.

**Perks**\
Alchemy offers potion quality increases, brewing speed, ingredient consumption reduction, splash potion and lingering potion buffs, throwing speed, etc.

\
_**> Potion Merging**_\
Usage: In your inventory, drag and drop a potion onto another with right-click.\
Description: Potion merge allows you, as the name implies, to combine the effects of two potions into one. The potion will suffer a small reduction in duration when this is done.

**How to gain EXP**\
You get experience through mining, specifically how many drops you get from a block. The more rare or difficult to mine a drop is, the more EXP it grants. Since EXP is based off of the drop amounts, using fortune will also grant you a lot more EXP. Using silk touch will grant about 2x drop EXP instead.

## Light Weapons ⚔

Light Weapons is your proficiency in fighting using light weaponry. The higher your skill in light weapons, the more damage you'll deal with them. Light weapons are the most defensive weapon class among light and heavy weapons, benefit from high attack speed, but lower damage.

**How to gain EXP**\
You get experience by dealing damage to enemies. Experience is based on the damage you deal, not the amount of times you hit them or how much you kill.

> ❗ Repeatedly getting experience in the same area (chunk) greatly reduces experience gained after a certain amount of times. This is to nerf mob farms. This counter is chunk-specific, and resets after server restarts.

**Special Notes**\
"Critical strikes" are different from vanilla critical strikes. Vanilla critical strikes which are done by falling while attacking are now referred to as "Power Attacks", which still do the usual 1.5x damage.&#x20;

## Archery 🏹

**Description**\
Archery is your proficiency in ranged combat. The higher your skill in archery, the more damage you'll deal with bows and crossbows and the more accurate you can shoot. Archery is one of the hardest classes to get started in due to decreased accuracy, but offer some of the highest ranged damage numbers once leveled.

**How to gain EXP**\
You get experience for every shot you hit, which further increases based on the damage you dealt with that shot AND the distance between you and the target.

**Special Notes**\
Damage is further influenced by your distance from the target, so short-ranged shorts do much less damage than long-ranged sniper shots. The Infinity enchantment is nerfed, making it so you deal 30% less damage with normal arrows. Custom arrows are not preserved with infinity, but it does provide an increased chance to not consume ammo.\
Ammo preserved using the "decreased ammo consumption" stat cannot be picked up again.\
When "ammo consumption reduction" is applied on a crossbow, it instantly reloads. This may be done up to 3 times in a row unless you have additional "crossbow magazine" stats.

Archery gives access to damage, accuracy, critical strikes, custom arrow recipes, ammo reduction, charged shots, etc.

## Light Armor 🔹

**Description**\
Light Armor represents how well you are able to protect yourself using less protective, but lighter armor. Light Armor doesn't slow you down as much as Heavy Armor and is better for the player that prefers staying mobile and being able to get away from situations easier, but is less effective against damage protection.

**How to gain EXP**\
You gain EXP for every point of damage you take. This is before mitigations, so having an increased armor value does not decrease EXP. You gain a slight EXP multiplier bonus for each point of armor of the type you have. You gain additional EXP for every second you're in combat, and this exp is granted when leaving combat. All this experience is multiplied by the amount of pieces of light armor you're wearing.

**Special Notes**\
By default, light armor slows you down for 3.75% per piece, or 15% with a full set. This movement speed penalty can be reduced, or removed entirely, through perk investment. Light armor does not provide any additional protections beyond armor value.

**Perks**\
Light Armor provides armor bonusses, dodge chance, hunger consumption reduction, set bonusses, Adrenaline, etc.

Abilities:\

## Heavy Armor 🔶

**Description**\

Heavy Armor significantly slows you down but is much better for the player that prefers staying in battle and dealing as much damage as they can, but will put you at a disadvantage should you ever need to retreat.

**How to gain EXP**\
You gain EXP for every point of damage you take. This is before mitigations, so having an increased armor value does not decrease EXP.

All this experience is multiplied by the amount of pieces of heavy armor you're wearing.
