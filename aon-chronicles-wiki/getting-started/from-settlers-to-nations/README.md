Use /t\[own] for Town Management and /n\[ation] for Nation Management
{% endhint %}

It's best to think of these two systems as part of a greater geo-politcal package. The physical impact on the Land is a Town, players live in Towns, but the influence placed over a region as a whole is a Nation.&#x20;

Towns can exist without Nations, but Nations cannot exist without Towns.

#### Towns

The Town System is designed for players who enjoy detailed town-building and management. It offers an extensive range of features that allow players to construct towns with a high degree of customization, from houses and farms to defenses and unique structures with specialized functions. The current tech-tree has around 140 structures, each with its own set of functionalities, and introduces them gradually to the players as they progress through six town upgrade levels, two war bases, and a mining colony.

Key features include:

* The ability to manage player membership at both the building and town levels, with towns having population limits based on housing.
* Towns require Resources for operations, some Buildings produce Resource, while others take away Resource.
* Unique government types for towns, offering customizable buffs and influencing town management styles.
* Advanced mechanics for buildings, including the creation and consumption of custom items, evolution into other structures, and automatic item transportation between Railway connected structures.

#### Nations

Nations shifts the focus from detailed town-building to the broader simulation of sovereignty and influence over a particular region. This is a framework for players to engage in the intricacies of nation-building, from claiming territory and managing social hierarchies to engaging in warfare and politics. Players can write laws, form alliances, and hold dueling tournaments, offering a rich tapestry of medieval societal simulation.

Key features include:

* Social Organization and Territory Management, allowing players to structure their nations and manage claimed lands.
* Vassal systems that enable the creation of complex social hierarchies and dependencies between players.
* Mechanisms for warfare, alliances, and laws, simulating the diplomatic and combative aspects of medieval societies.
