### Lore

Humans are one of the newest species to exist, having a well-documented first appearance at about -4000 years ago. Humans are a diverse and resourceful species that owes it's existence to the unlikely union of Faefolk and Dweller societies.

#### Appearance

Taller and slimmer than Dwellers, yet stockier and shorter than Faefolk, Humans posses a wide spectrum of features both physical and societal. Being relatively new among the vastly more ancient races, Humans are often less stereotyped by other species, having contributed very little to the grand sum of historical events. Due to this perception, Humans traveling outside of the Overworld often find themselves caught up and assigned as neutral mediators between inter-species conflicts. Not all humans take kindly to this, "blank canvas" perception, and try very hard to establish their identity as unique or extraordinary.

#### History

Early on in its history, the Overworld was created to exist as a nexus between worlds, a hub in which multiple species could share ideas, knowledge, and culture, having no official Mod or people assigned to occupy its domain. However, this lack of liability and self-agency made the Overworld a prime target for Nether occupation during the Age of Fire. It was during one of the most severe eras of Nether dominion that Mankind made its first appearance among the shared villages of Faefolk and Dwellers. Although most Netherkin would quickly dismiss it as being a blatant form of historical fiction, there is a popular belief among Humans that it was their unexpected and exceptional arrival that finally drove out the Netherkin from the Overworld.

#### Architecture

Humans are commonly found constructing simple villages and houses. Although individual homes may feature a degree a variety, most other species might describe Human architecture as being rudimentary and uncultured.

#### Affinity for Anarchy

Due to the Overworld being a neutral territory set apart from the dominion of any singular Mod, many creatures often flee there seeking relief from the harsh dominion of other dimensions. In turn, Humans that have lived much of their life saturated in the laissez-faire sentimentalities of the Overworld might struggle to adapt to other realms in which theocratic rule is more present and absolute.
