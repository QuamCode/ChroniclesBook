### Lore

The Netherkin are the fiesty, fire-proof, and mischievous race of blazing firepower located in the Nether. Often getting in fights and hunting for the sport, much like their mod, [The Tyrant](../../../lore-of-the-lands/mods-and-gods/the-tyrant.md), war, no matter how devastating is celebrating, and the highest honor in Netherkin society is to die whilst in combat defending the nether, or spreading conquest of the nether faction elsewhere in The Cornucopia. Despite the war-like nature of many Netherkin societies, there are some smaller villages and sub-cultures of Netherkin who wish for peace and trade between races, and only wish to use their intrinsic violence against the harmful creatures of the many dimensions.

#### Appearance

Netherkin are a species all about the control and resistance to flame. They have special organs, that if removed the Netherkin would have a much tougher time regulating body temperature, and may not be able to cast fire abilities or swim in lava without overheating. On their backs are two small holes that allow for the venting of more heat after casting fire spells or magic.&#x20;

Their skin is a similar consistency and material to ghast flesh, being a little less rough more akin to human skin. Some Netherkin have red, or jet black coloring on their skin instead of the usual greyish white. They can expel fire based attacks from their hands and legs, which will give off the appearance of singed hands and legs, being more darker and covered in soot and ash. Lastly, their eyes are fully black with dark red iris and black pupils. Flammable oils sometimes leak from their eyes similar to ghasts that can result in a cheetah-like pattern on their face. Some Netherkin style the oils in special patterns for fashion

#### Architecture and Culture

The architecture of the Netherkin is very reminiscent, and loosely based of Eastern Asian Oriental design. Nihon kenchiku-esque structures hang from the ceilings of the nether, as entire cities are often located far above the heads, whereas lower class villages are located on the bottoms of some lava oceans. However, some portions of cities are encased in lava so only Netherkin, or people with fire resistance potions can access them. Shrines and temples are quite common, with many being on the ground and others incorporated on the cielings of nether cities. The nether fortress a relic of Netherkin past, back when the majority of their cities were built in the ground and caves.

The culture of Netherkin is, to no surprise, centered around war and fighting. Military training camps, weapon smith forges, and fighting rings are some of the more common buildings and job occupations. In fact, fighting rings and arenas are the staple sport Netherkin celebrate together. Netherkin are the second most hired hand for bounties and as mercenaries, under [Hunters](hunter/). Despite their infatuation with violence, the Netherkin still have an orderly culture, one of respect and honor to the Nether. When not fighting, Netherkin enjoy a variety of other activities together, such as molten hotsprings or calligraphy with oil and flame. Netherkin are said to put on stellar shows with easy access to all kinds of pyrotechnics. If you enjoy spicy food, a Netherkin restaurant offers all kind of flaming cuisines to consume. Transportation can vary from city to city, but many use striders as well as a special giant fire salamander for the higher class.

Some of the small societies of the Netherkin focus much less on violence and war, and more on trading and camaraderie with other races. These cities are more hidden away and usually only told of amongst trusted peoples, as regular Netherkin society despises their peaceful ideals, and are shunned. As such, the peaceful Netherkin hide away in buildings built inside the netherrack, hidden away from the sprawling ceiling cities of regular Netherkin culture. These peaceful cultures usually take to hunting to satiate their want for violence, going out to hunt pests or large problematic beasts in a multitude of dimensions.

Netherkin usually wear similar garments like the kimono, except with a much thinner fabrics as the heat of the nether doesn't require thick clothing for the Netherkin. Some types of Netherkin enjoy thin styles of fabrics in a similar vein to sports bras, or sleeveless shirts as well. Special types of clothing can be imbued with fire-bending abilities, usually worn by females, and the men's clothing usually has lots of pouches to accomodate weaponry.

#### Physiology

The physiology of a Netherkin is centered towards putting all power towards flame. In place of a regular heart, there is a powerful life flame that breathes power throughout their whole body. It works as a flame regulator as well as lungs that breathe through their mouths. In place of lungs, a large tube system of the oily-black substance is filtered throughout their whole body, allowing flames to pass throughout the entire system without damaging internal organs. The liver and stomach are combined into one called a Cophtrophe, which filters heat and spice into energy. In the case of regular food, in turns the food into more heat, where waste is then turned into odorless, fog-like gas and sent out through the vent holes as a way of removal of unnecessary minerals. Despite this act being relatively harmless and unbothering to the normal Netherkin society, for some reason other races are revolted at this act in public, saying things like "_Ew dude, are you really going to the bathroom in front of me?!_" to the confusion of the Netherkin.

Generally, Netherkin are carnivores, but are not averse to the prospect of eating other types of food aside from meat, especially in the category of carbs such as breads or noodle dishes.

#### Folbaullie

Folbaullie is the fighting ring sport of Netherkin culture. The rules are very simple: first one to fall is loser and one standing is the winner. Different variations of Folbaullie exist, some with weaponry, where others are all about hand-to-hand combat, some are magic-exclusive.

One of the more unique variations, called "Spleef", named after the Netherkin who invented the game type, puts users on falling platforms. There are several layers of platforms one can fall too, and a variety of different ways of getting rid of the floor, such as running or throwing at the item at the ground below. Each layer you fall to breaks the life charm more and more, until the last layer you can fall through. If you fall through the last layer, the life charm shatters, teleporting you outside the arena. This gametype is the most popular with outsiders, being adapted to many types and is the most popular of the Netherkin with humanity, who has taken a fond liking to Spleef.

#### Mortality and Reproduction

Reproduction works in a very similar way to human reproduction, with respective reproduction organs. However, instead Netherkin have small life flames that are kindled at the point of reproduction. This flame can be put on ignitable surfaces, and if properly nourished and taken care of, the flames will burst and dissipate, revealing a small netherkin child. As the flame can be fragile, great care is taken to make sure the life flame transforms into a child.

Mortality works very similar to human mortality, with one key difference: Netherkin, at death, have a much, much faster decomposition rate and have a chance to become Withered. An average Netherkin corpse can decompose within five to ten minutes. In its place, the Netherkin can fall to ash, or given the right circumstance turn to ashen Skeleton instead. This ash can seep into the ground, resulting, over a period of time, in soul sand. Some Netherkin who lived happy lives have a wither rose growing on their soul sand, despite not directly turning into Withered remains upon death.
