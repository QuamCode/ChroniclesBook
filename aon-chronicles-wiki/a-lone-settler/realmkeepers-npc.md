# 🙏 Realmkeepers \[NPC]

### Lore

Realmkeepers are a powerful peacekeeping race, occupying the Pax dimension. Sworn to maintain order throughout all dimensions, many opinions of them vary from being overzealous and intrusive, to altruistic and kind-hearted. In reality, the true nature of a Realmkeeper is more than meets the eye.

#### Appearance

Realmkeepers have dark skin, glistening yellow irises with pointing, star-like pupils, golden hair and a slight radiance emanating from their bodies called Thélisis. Thélisis might be described as a kind of force or energy shimmering from a Realmkeepr's body that shields it from damage. Thélisis has a powerful oxidizing effect that can corrode any metal that has the slightest of impurities and even bleach clothing. Realmkeepers favor wearing golden armor over other armor variants due to its non-corrosive properties and thus might try to get a hold of as much gold from other realms as possible. The event of a Realmkeeper’s Thélisis binding to a suit of armor is called the Midas effect.

#### Architecture and Culture

The architecture of Realmkeepers contains great quartz cathedrals with majestic dome-shaped roofs and luscious gardens accented with gold. Realmkeeper culture is based greatly around integrous, almost chivalric behavior. Realmkeepers consider themselves to be saviors of all realms and hold themselves to almost impossibly high standards of conduct. Truly believing their morals and system of society to be superior to all alternatives, Realmkeepers have spent considerable time and resources on improving public relations with other realms and rallying all other races to join in their cause and way of life. While the ubiquitous presence of powerful Realmkkepers is seen as a blessing by some, others dislike the policing presence they offer. Many Realmkeepers believe in a prophecy foretelling a future time in which all warfare will be abolished from every dimension. Most among those believing in the portent work passionately to hurry along its fulfillment.

#### History

Though most Realmkepers are unaware and would would take great offence to the realization, Pax is not the original home dimension of the Realmkeepers. In truth, their origins hail from Dormis. Initially called Wardens, they had once lived harsh lives as natives dwelling within the prison dimension. The ancient race was commonly recruited by the Judge Moddess to serve as a locally-driven extension of her authority over the prison population. Centuries later, all things changed with the sweeping approach of the Cambrian virus. Due to their resilience and loyalty, Wardens were afforded the role of Realmkeeper and assigned the duty of pushing back the devastating virus. In the end, their labors proved successful and all realms were preserved. Realmkkeepers were thus rewarded with a peaceful new home in Pax provided they continually fulfill their oath as protectors.

#### Affinity for Justice

Realmkeepers tend to posses a deep sense of right and wrong, and often feel an overwhelming need to correct perceived injustices. Healing the sick, protecting the weak, Reealmkeepers are often viewed as heroes for their actions. Many across the realms feel a deep sense of gratitude regarding their past and present deeds. For others however, the Realmkeeper cause is an infuriating one, perceived as a meddling presence run by intolerant hypocrites. Villains, more than all others, tend to harbor this resentment potently, as it is the Realmkeepers who fervently seek them out to return them to their prison in Dormis.
