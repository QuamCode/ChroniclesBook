Aon Chronicles: Pre-Industrialized Nation Play in a Dimensional Paradigm!&#x20;

It is a Town, Medieval Geo-Politic-Esque server with a focus on custom 'Pre-Industrialized' Town Creation and RPG Exploration with a multi-dimensional spin.&#x20;

It features RPG Race Selection (Much like the popular Origins Mod), a fully-fledged Town Creation System with Buildings and Resource Generating Structures, a unique stacked world design with **14** dimensions to explore with completely revamped vanilla, a progressive Story that spans worlds,  hundreds of custom items, item sets and plenty of unique bosses and world dungeon structures.

The easiest way to put it: Modded Minecraft but all while maintaining compatibility with Vanilla Bedrock and Java Minecraft!&#x20;
